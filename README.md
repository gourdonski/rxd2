# RxD2

Messing around with the Bungie API for Destiny 2 and ngrx because I ran out of end-game content while waiting for the first DLC to drop.

Based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@nomanbinhussein/getting-started-with-ngrx-5cec2788b25f) by Noman Hasan and the ngrx [example app](https://github.com/ngrx/example-app).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
